In programming, a process refers to an instance of a program that is executed by the computer's operating system. Each process has its own memory space, code, data, and system resources. Processes are used to execute tasks or run programs concurrently, allowing for multitasking in computer systems.

Programming languages and libraries provide tools and APIs for working with processes, allowing developers to control their execution and interaction within an application.

In programming, signals are a form of asynchronous notification or interruption that can be sent to a running program or process. Signals are used to notify a program about specific events or conditions that occur outside of its normal execution flow. These events can include user actions, hardware interrupts, or exceptional conditions. Programmers can define signal handlers or routines to handle specific signals, allowing programs to respond to events gracefully.
